Hello! This is G123u, thanks for downloading this 3DCG hair edit of mine.
The hair texture used is from my "Colorfully Lighted Hair Texture" pack.
The hair is simply rigged, but shouldn't have any problems.
If you find any major problems, please let me know.

This hair is converted by MMDMiko on DeviantART.
Editing and redistributing edits is perfectly fine as long as MMDMiko is credited.
Crediting me, G123u, is not necessary, but would be greatly appreciated. c:
